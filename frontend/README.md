# Frontend Application

This is the frontend for the application built with **React**, designed to work seamlessly with the Node.js backend and PostgreSQL database. It provides a modern, responsive user interface with full type safety.

##  Quick Start

### Prerequisites
Before starting the frontend, ensure the backend services are running:

```bash
# 1. Start backend and database (in backend directory)

# 2. Then start frontend (in frontend directory)

pnpm install
pnpm run dev

# The terminal will display a local development URL. Simply copy this URL and paste it into your browser - the application will be fully functional and ready to use.
